# Changelog

All notable changes to the "GravityChat" project will be documented in this file.

## [v2.6.5] - "Modular Extraction & Audit Green" - 2026-02-24

### Highlights

- **Component Extraction**: Extracted `showAuthOverlay` → `src/components/auth.ts` and `runCodeBlock` → `src/components/sandbox-ui.ts` from the monolithic `main.ts`.
- **Prompt Extraction**: Moved the ~200-line Oracular Function system prompt into `src/prompts/oracular.ts` as an importable constant (`ORACULAR_PROMPT`), keeping `state.ts` clean.
- **Purple Ban Compliance**: Replaced all `purple`/`fuchsia`/`magenta` CSS classes in `index.html` with `indigo`/`pink` to comply with design rules.
- **SEO Fix**: Added Open Graph meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:image`) to `index.html`.
- **Test Runner Fix**: Fixed Windows compatibility — `npm` → `npm.cmd` in the Python test runner script.
- **Audit Scope Fix**: Excluded irrelevant directories (`codeaudit/`, `venv/`, `chrome_data/`, `Grok-Api-main/`) from UX and SEO audits; removed `.css` from UX audit scan (false positives without HTML context).
- **Full Checklist Pass**: All 6 gates green — Security, Lint, Schema, Tests, UX Audit, SEO.

## [v2.6.4] - "Zero-Trust Audit" - 2026-02-19

### Highlights

- **TypeScript Runtime Audit**: Conducted a comprehensive 18-point behavioral audit to ensure runtime equivalence after the TS migration.
- **Identified Regressions**:
  - **Media Lab**: Discovered critical runtime syntax errors in HTML templates due to hardcoded TS casts in string literals (`src/components/media-lab.ts`).
  - **Audio Flow**: Identified a "Half-Duplex" breakage where new message sends fail to interrupt active audio queues, causing overlapping playback.
  - **Window Chrome**: Found the Electron window still using standard OS frames instead of the intended frameless draggable design.
  - **Bootstrapper Risks**: Identified a lack of error handling in the `index.html` theme bootstrapper that could lead to crashes on corrupted `localStorage`.
- **System Verification**:
  - **Neural Memory**: Verified recursive indexing and exclusion logic is stable and leak-free.
  - **Local LLM**: Confirmed successful streaming and response handling via the Python bridge.
  - **AI Streaming**: Verified smooth typewriter effects and markdown/highlighting resilience.
- **Compliance**: Identified that the "Executioner Sandbox" is currently non-functional due to Puter.js V2 API changes (awaiting backend executor).

## [v2.6.3] - "TypeScript Awakening" - 2026-02-19

### Highlights

- **Full Workspace Migration**: Successfully migrated the entire `src/` directory to TypeScript.
- **Remaining Components Migrated**: Converted `chat.js`, `input.js`, `media-lab.js`, `oracular.js`, `voice-browser.js`, and `voice-controls.js` to `.ts`.
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Defined comprehensive interfaces for `AppState`, `Persona`, `Session`, and `ChatMessage`, ensuring strict type checking across the codebase.
- **Stability**: Fixed numerous potential null-pointer exceptions and implicit `any` type issues identified during the TSC build process. Verified with clean `tsc` build.
- **Refinement**: Cleaned up `index.html` script tags and improved event handling types in `input.ts`.

## [v2.6.2] - "Polished Reliability" - 2026-02-19

### Highlights

- **Centralized Logger**: Added `src/utils/logger.js`. Integrated into all core services (`ai`, `voice`, `storage`, `local-llm`, `memory`) for professional-grade observability and debugging.
- **Improved UX**: Added built-in loading spinners specifically for AI response bubbles. Users now get immediate feedback before streaming begins.
- **Accessibility (Step 5)**: Comprehensive ARIA label audit for all functional buttons and enhanced modal roles for better screen reader compatibility.
- **Audit Fixes**:
  - Resolved broken relative imports across modularized components (`concatenated path errors`).
  - Hardened Sandbox (The Executioner) against XSS by switching to `textContent` for program output.
  - Fully restored Media Lab (Step 7) by implementing `setMediaParam` and binding it to global namespace.
  - Implemented state pruning for `AppState.messages` (Step 10) to prevent KV storage overflow.
  - Integrated Media Lab parameters into AI image and video generation prompts.
- **UI Architecture**: Moved legacy inline styles from `index.html` into structured CSS. Updated app-wide versioning to sync with `package.json`.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Added micro-animations, pulsing glows for model status indicators, and smooth transition logic for sidebar interactions.

## [v2.6.1] - "A New Perspective" - 2026-02-18

### UI / UX

- **Smart Tooltips**: Added rich, context-aware hover cards for all models. Cloud models show pricing/provider info, and Hugging Face search results show detailed metadata without clipping.
- **Tab Insights**: Hovering the "DOWNLOAD (HF)" tab now explains what the Hugging Face Hub is for new users.
- **Voice Browser**: Styled the language dropdown to match the app's glassmorphism aesthetic.
- **Fixes**: Resolved a flickering issue in the model list caused by aggressive auto-refresh during search navigation.

## [v2.6.0] - "Local Intelligence" - 2026-02-18

### Features

- **Local LLM Support**: Added full support for running local `.gguf` models (via `llama-cpp-python` and CUDA). You can now run offline AI directly on your GPU.
- **Local Model Manager**: New sidebar interface to scan, load, and unload models from your `local_models` folder.
- **Process Management**: Completely rewrote `launcher.py` to use Windows Job Objects. This ensures that when you close the app window, ALL background processes (Python servers, Chrome instances, Nodes) are instantly and reliably terminated. No more zombie processes.
- **Panic Button**: Added `kill_all.bat` to the root folder as a manual override to force-close everything if needed.

## [v2.5.3] - "Panic Button" - 2026-02-18

### System

- **Process Management**: Implemented **Windows Job Objects** in `launcher.py`. This acts as a "dead man's switch" — if the main launcher dies, Windows INSTANTLY kills all child processes (Grok, Chrome, TTS, Python), preventing zombie process floods.
- **Cleanup Intelligence**: Upgraded `cleanup_backend.ps1` to specifically target Playwright-spawned Chrome instances (via `--user-data-dir` matching) while leaving your personal browser sessions untouched.
- **Panic Button**: Added `kill_all.bat` to the root directory. Double-clicking this immediately force-terminates all GravityChat-related processes if something gets stuck.

## [v2.5.2] - 2026-02-18

### UI / UX

- **Rebrand**: Updated the loading screen text to "LOADING ALL SEEING CAT..." with a sleek neon style and pulse animation.
- **Startup**: Fixed the jarring white flash on app launch by enforcing a dark background (`#0a0a0f`) via inline styles and updated window showing logic.
- **Components**: Redesigned the "Send" button to be a transparent circle with a neon border (`btn-sleek-send`). Cleaned up the "Stop" button styling.
- **Settings**: Toned down the "Advanced / Debug" section header color to a relaxed gray (`#9ca3af`) and adjusted container opacity for a calmer aesthetic.

### Fixed

- **FOUC**: Injected inline styles to `<html>` and `<body>` to prevent any styling delay flashes.

## [v2.5.1] - "All Seeing Cat" - 2026-02-18

### UI / UX

- **Rebrand**: Officially renamed application to **All Seeing Cat**. New icon, title, and splash screen.
- **Files Sidebar**: Modernized with sleek icon-only buttons (New File, New Folder, Refresh) and a glass-morphism path indicator. "Index Memory" button made more subtle.
- **Window**: Removed the default Electron menu bar for a cleaner, native-app feel.
- **Settings**: Redesigned the **Advanced / Debug** section to be compact and themes-aware (using dynamic CSS variables for borders/colors). Removed outdated "Grok Automation" section.

### Fixed

- **Startup**: Resolved critical "Puter is undefined" error by correctly configuring `nodeIntegration: false` / `contextIsolation: true` in `electron-main.js`.
- **Icons**: Fixed transparency issues with the app icon by using the correct source image.

## [v2.5.0] - "Voice Interruption" - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Voice**: Implemented **Robust Interruption Handling**. Voice playback now instantly stops (`stopSpeech`) when a chat is cleared or a session is deleted, preventing orphaned audio.
- **Voice**: Added **Microphone Management** during modal interactions. The microphone is now automatically paused (`voiceSuspended` state) when the Voice Browser modal is open and resumes automatically upon closing/confirming.
- **System**: Introduced `isProcessingIntent` state to `AppState` to prevent input collisions during hidden background AI commands (e.g., persona/mode switches).
- **Architecture**: Decoupled the voice system into **Modular Engines** (`engine.js`) and **Logic flows** (`logic.js`) for better testability and maintenance.
- **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` to the Stop Generation button and improved **Keyboard Navigation** for the session list (tabindex, focus states, and Enter key support).

### Fixed

- **System**: Fixed a race condition where double-sending "hidden" messages could cause the AI to stall or enter an inconsistent state.
- **UI**: Cleaned up the Settings sidebar by moving manual/advanced Grok session inputs and "Reboot Core" into a dedicated **Advanced / Debug** collapsible section.
- **Voice**: Resolved an issue where closing the voice browser wouldn't resume listening even if "Continuous Voice" was active.

## [v2.4.2] - "Browser Bridge" - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Grok Bridge**: Implemented **Browser Driver Architecture** (`grok_driver.py`) using Playwright to bypass 403 Forbidden errors. This routes traffic through a real Chrome instance, overcoming aggressive anti-bot measures.
- **Grok Bridge**: Added **Streaming Emulation** for driver responses. The bridge now wraps scraped browser text into a simulated token stream compatible with the GravityChat UI.
- **Grok Bridge**: Integrated **Emoji Suppression** logic. Every request sent to the driver automatically appends a "do not use emojis" instruction to keep responses clean.

### Fixed

- **Grok Bridge**: Multi-layered **DOM Scraper** fallback system in `grok_driver.py` ensures responses are captured even if Grok's UI changes classes (using `.prose`, `message` divs, and `p` tags).
- **Grok Bridge**: Corrected `api_server.py` request body handling to fix `AttributeError: 'Request' object has no attribute 'proxy'`.

## [v2.4.1] - "Session Stability" - 2026-02-17

## [v2.4.0] - "Live Roster" - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Voice**: **Edge TTS Bridge** integration (`edge_tts_server.py`) providing access to 300+ high-quality Microsoft voices for free.
- **Voice**: New **Voice Browser** modal with search, language filters, and real-time voice previews (▶).
- **Voice**: Expanded Cloud voices to 40+ AWS Polly options supporting 20+ languages (Finnish, Japanese, Korean, etc.).
- **Models**: **Quality Tier Badging** (S/A/B/C) for all models to help users find the most capable free and premium models.
- **Models**: Refresh button (🔄) next to the model search input with animated feedback and toast reporting.
- **Chat**: Improved **Stop Generation** (⏹) button that now pins to the bottom-right and correctly aborts both text streaming and audio playback.
- **Settings**: Redesigned **Temperature Slider** with a sleek thin-line UI, small thumb, and **magnetic snap** at the default value (0.5) with an "Optimal" guide mark.
- **System**: Merged all bridge consoles (Grok & Edge TTS) into the **single main window** using PowerShell background processes in `start.bat`.
- **System**: Added a **3-second warmup delay** in `start.bat` to prevent "Connection Refused" errors when the browser launches before the servers are ready.
- **Diagnostics**: Enhanced `diagnosePuterModels()` to specifically test S-Tier models (DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o-Mini, Claude Haiku).

### Fixed

- **System**: Cleaned up startup sequence and added auto-cleanup of background Python processes on exit.
- **UI**: Added dark theme styling for modal dropdowns and search inputs to prevent light-theme clash.
- **Logic**: AI Fallback now specifically detects Puter's `"no fallback model available"` and `"overloaded"` errors to instantly cycle to the next candidate.

## [v2.3.9] - "Signal Clarity" - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `setupInputListeners` crashed on missing shortcut buttons (`btn-shortcut-image/video/ocr`), causing `Listeners setup failed` error on every startup. Added null guards.
- **AI Fallback**: Puter's `"no fallback model available"` error wasn't triggering our fallback chain because `error.error` (Puter's plain-object format) wasn't being extracted — only `error.message` was checked.
- **Fallback Chain**: Updated `FREE_FALLBACK_CHAIN` with proper `openrouter:` prefixed model IDs. Bare IDs like `google/gemma-2-9b-it:free` don't route correctly through Puter.
- **Health Check**: Removed auto-switch behavior from model health check — it was recursively trying every model on selection and causing cascading failures. Now just logs a warning; actual chat call handles fallback.
- **Debug Server**: Increased log truncation from 100→500 chars so error messages are fully visible.

## [v2.3.8] - "Clean Stream" - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Grok**: Added Grok 4.20 (Beta) to model selection — available in both the sidebar model picker and the Python API bridge.

### Fixed

- **Grok**: Stripped raw `xai:tool_usage_card` / `xai:tool_name` / `xai:tool_args` metadata from Grok API responses. These internal tool invocation markers (web search, code execution, etc.) were leaking into the chat as visible text. Fix applied to all three response paths: streaming, non-streaming new conversation, and non-streaming reply.

## [v2.3.7] - "Fallback Modal" - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **UI**: Added a dedicated info modal to notify users when a model fallback occurs, replacing the transient toast notification.
- **UX**: Implemented instant model health check on selection. If the selected model is offline, the app immediately switches to a working fallback and notifies the user *before* they type a message.
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where the "Stop" button would not appear during audio playback for Grok model responses.
- **Grok**: Upgrade to v2.3.7 with full streaming support (requires `api_server.py` restart).
- **System**: Fixed Grok streaming stalling when app is minimized or in background tab.
- **System**: Added automatic self-healing for 'moderation loop' errors (auto-wipes corrupted state).
- **Voice**: Fixed "Stop" button killing the microphone in continuous voice mode. It now properly restarts listening.
- **UI**: Added logic to visually disable/fade the temperature slider when using Grok models (since they don't support it).

### Fixed

- **Critical Model Fallback**: Updated chat execution to dynamically fetch available models from Puter API instead of relying on potentially outdated hardcoded lists, resolving "Model not found" errors.

## [v2.3.5] - "Model Reliability" - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Model Fallback**: Updated the automatic fallback chain to favor more reliable models (Google Gemma 2, Llama 3.1) over experimental ones to prevent chat failures.
- **Model Fetch**: Updated the default model list to exclude deprecated models.
- **Voice UI**: Consolidated all voice status messages (Listening, Transcribing, Errors) into the dedicated status bar above the input field, removing overlapping toast notifications.

## [v2.3.4] - "Compliance Audit" - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **API Compliance**: Updated `puter.ai.txt2speech` to use the correct v2 signature (options object instead of 3 arguments).
- **File System**: Fixed a potential crash in `loadFiles` where `puter.fs.read` returns a Blob instead of a string (v2 standard).
- **Image Generation**: Corrected the `puter.ai.txt2img` call to pass options correctly, enabling proper style selection.

## [v2.3.3] - "Polish & Stability" - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Model List Sync**: Fixed an issue where premium models were visible in free mode on startup by ensuring the toggle state is synchronized before models are fetched.
- **Chat Crash**: Resolved a critical "fullText is not defined" error that occurred during model fallback, preventing the app from crashing when a provider fails.
- **Persona Creation**: Newly created personas are no longer automatically selected, allowing for batch creation without context switching.
- **Voice Logic**: Fixed a duplicate variable declaration in `voice.js` that could cause runtime errors.

### Changed

- **UI Renaming**: Renamed "Main Chat" to "Chat List" in the sidebar for better clarity.
- **Voice UI**:
  - Moved the "Listening..." status indicator from ephemeral toast notifications to a dedicated, persistent status bar above the input field.
  - The microphone button now clears its active state correctly when recording stops.

## [v2.3.2] - "Polished" - 2026-02-17

- **Moved**: Voice stop button from AI message bubble corner → send button. When AI speaks, send button transforms into a pulsing red stop with tooltip.
- **Added**: Hover tooltip ("Stop AI voice") on the stop button using CSS `::after` pseudo-element.
- **Added**: Loading overlay to prevent FOUC — theme, persona, and chats now load behind a spinner before the app reveals.

## [v2.3.1] - "Hardened" - 2026-02-17

### Security (Critical)

- **Fixed**: XSS via modal title/message injection — all 3 modal functions now use `textContent` instead of raw `innerHTML`.
- **Fixed**: XSS via toast messages — toast content now uses safe text injection.
- **Fixed**: XSS via persona names — added HTML entity escaping in persona list rendering.

### Bugs

- **Fixed**: Dead code in `waitForAIIdle()` — removed unreachable duplicate `return true`.
- **Fixed**: Half-duplex mic race condition — guarded all `startRecording()` calls with `!isSpeakingAudio` check.
- **Fixed**: Voice stop button vanishing after streaming ends — button is re-injected after final `innerHTML` update.
- **Fixed**: Overly broad fallback trigger — removed `errorMsg.includes('error')` which caught everything.
- **Fixed**: Partial streaming recovery — mid-stream failures now preserve partial content instead of losing it.

### Performance

- **Fixed**: AudioContext memory leak — contexts are now tracked and explicitly closed on stop.
- **Fixed**: ObjectURL memory leak in chat export — `URL.revokeObjectURL()` now called after download.

### Code Quality

- **Improved**: Replaced unsafe `Object.assign(AppState, settings)` with whitelist-only key assignment.
- **Improved**: Extracted `MAX_CONTEXT_MESSAGES` constant (was magic number `-20`).
- **Improved**: Extracted `INTENT_MODEL` constant for voice command parsing model.
- **Improved**: Added `.catch()` to fire-and-forget `sendHiddenMessage` promises.
- **Improved**: Disabled non-functional RUN buttons in code blocks (Puter V2 sandbox unavailable).
- **Removed**: Duplicate comment in `completeInit`.
- **Added**: Missing `showToast` import in `modals.js`.

### UX/Accessibility

- **Added**: Escape key support for all 3 modal types.
- **Added**: `aria-label` on dynamically-created voice stop button.
- **Added**: 2-second cooldown on voice commands to prevent API spam.
- **Added**: Console log when DOM prunes old messages (>50 visible).
- **Added**: Theme CSS variable documentation block in `main.css`.

### Infrastructure

- **Improved**: `start.bat` — added existence checks for Grok venv, api_server.py, and debug_server.py with warnings instead of silent failures. Fixed version display and step numbering.
